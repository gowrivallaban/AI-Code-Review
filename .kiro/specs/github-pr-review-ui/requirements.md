# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a web-based user interface for GitHub pull request code reviews. Users can select a GitHub repository, browse available pull requests, and perform automated code reviews using configurable LLM-based templates. The system allows users to view, accept, modify, or remove review comments in an intuitive interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select a GitHub repository from my accessible repositories, so that I can review pull requests from that specific project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a repository selection interface
2. WHEN I authenticate with GitHub THEN the system SHALL fetch and display my accessible repositories
3. WHEN I select a repository THEN the system SHALL store the selection and proceed to the pull request listing
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry option

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all available pull requests for the selected repository, so that I can choose which PR to review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository is selected THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all open pull requests
2. WHEN displaying pull requests THEN the system SHALL show PR title, number, author, and creation date
3. WHEN I click on a pull request THEN the system SHALL navigate to the code review interface
4. IF no pull requests exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure code review templates, so that I can customize the review criteria and prompts used by the LLM.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing review settings THEN the system SHALL provide a template editor interface
2. WHEN I modify a template THEN the system SHALL save the changes to a markdown file
3. WHEN templates are loaded THEN the system SHALL parse markdown content for review criteria
4. IF template parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent saving

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run automated code reviews on selected pull requests using LLM analysis, so that I can get intelligent feedback on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a pull request THEN the system SHALL display a "Run Code Review" button
2. WHEN I click "Run Code Review" THEN the system SHALL fetch PR diff and send to LLM with template
3. WHEN LLM analysis completes THEN the system SHALL parse and display review comments
4. IF LLM analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display error message and retry option
5. WHEN review is running THEN the system SHALL show progress indicator

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view code review comments in a well-formatted sidebar, so that I can easily read and understand the feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN review comments are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated sidebar
2. WHEN displaying comments THEN the system SHALL show file name, line number, and comment text
3. WHEN I click on a comment THEN the system SHALL highlight the relevant code section
4. WHEN comments are long THEN the system SHALL provide expandable/collapsible sections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to accept, modify, or remove individual review comments, so that I can curate the final review feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a comment THEN the system SHALL provide accept, edit, and delete action buttons
2. WHEN I click accept THEN the system SHALL mark the comment as approved for final review
3. WHEN I click edit THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of comment text
4. WHEN I click delete THEN the system SHALL remove the comment from the review
5. WHEN I save edits THEN the system SHALL update the comment content
6. WHEN I cancel edits THEN the system SHALL revert to original comment text

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export or submit the final curated review, so that I can share the feedback with the PR author.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I finish curating comments THEN the system SHALL provide export/submit options
2. WHEN I export review THEN the system SHALL generate formatted markdown or text output
3. WHEN I submit review THEN the system SHALL post comments directly to GitHub PR
4. IF GitHub submission fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback export option
